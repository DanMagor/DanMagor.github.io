In summer of 2017, I participated in interesting project from Student Affairs Office(Innopolis University). The idea was to make gamification of the Handbook, which usually is gived out to each freshman in university. The Handbook is note-size book that contains all needed information for live in our campus. 

During the developing process, as a person with the biggest experience in gamedev(the biggest in the team, but it was not so enourmous, actually :D), it was desided that I lead the team. For me it was interesting task: to lead the team of people in gamedev project, when they had never had experience in such things. 

There was a several ideas about handbook gamification, but there was important reasons to use telegram bot:   

1. Telegram is the main way of communication in Innopolis.
2. It was cross platform realization for any device.
3. We wanted to get some experience in bot developing.
4. We thought, that write text quest with photo is easier than some graphic based game.
5. We wanted to get experience in developing with Python, which is very appropriate for telegram bots development.

As the result we developed bot, fisrtly without any pictures and only in Russia. Then we added a mechanism of photo sending. We found photographer girl in our team, who made all photos for bot.

Innopolis University is international university, so on the next iteration we added opportunity to play in English

And also we added opportunity to play for girl. And Yeah, gameplay changes because of it!

 My responsibilites were:    
* Team management  
* Game design of the game
* Botâ€™s programming   

It was the first project of such type for me and I'm proud of it, because freshmen liked it and it was really useful.

And actually I am going to find team of people, who will be ready to update information in bot(and fixe some typos :)) and launch it for the next comming students.

You can test bot by yourself right here [@HelloFreshmanBot](http://t.me/HelloFreshmanBot)   
(after '/start' command wait 5-10 sec until bot starts on server. It takes some time because bot is deployed on free Heroku server.)
