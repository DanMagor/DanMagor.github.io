# HELLO WORLD!

If you see this post, you found the first post on this site.   

So, what is this blog about? I am going to post here some of my work, results, thoughts, articles. Most of them of course would me about gamedev. 

In the moment when I wrote this post I studied in [Innopolis University](https://university.innopolis.ru/en/). I am only at the beginning of my way in game development industry, but I have a goal: work in Valve Company. Maybe in some moment my life would change and I would decide that this goal is already not suitable for me and it will change.  

So, let's see, but for now let me just introduce my project that I worked on:

[Wild Card]({{site.url}}/wild-card/)
{: style="text-align: center; font-size: 200%;"}
[![Wild Card Image]({{site.url}}/files/portfolio/Wild_Card/main_screen.png)]({{site.url}}/wild-card/)  

Wild Card is reaction based multiplayer card game in wild west style. The main idea of the game is combination of strateginc thinking and dynamic-reaction based tempo. Both players know the cards of each other, but they don't know which one the opponent choose and how he would use it.   

If player choose a card earlier than opponent do it, it will get "initiative effect" which gives him some additional benefits. So, you can spent time for thinking, but there is a big chance, that opponent will take his benefits for early choose. And yeah, anyway time for choose is limited and it's short, actually. So, think fast!
For now we, the members of [Indie Gamedev Club](http://www.indiegamedev.club/) works on two project, one of them is **Wild Card**. So it's not only my project, but the main idea was created by me. 

Our next goal is to prepare playble Beta version for [DevGAMM Moscow 2019](http://devgamm.com) in May. During the develpoment process I am going to write some articles about our work. Keep in touch!

See you soon,
