## Work Experience:

**Position: _Game designer Intern_**   
**In:** [_Fair Games Company_](http://fairgames.studio/)   
**Period:** *2018 Summer*   
**My work:**   
I worked on the part of "Start-up Simulator". I **developed sites** for in-game internet simulation. Also the big part of my work was **mini-games**. During the internship, I designed such mini-games as: "bar darts", "drag-racing", "board game", "isometric shooter" and several others. The main idea of these mini games was that there was correlation between mini-game results and player's relationships with characters in the game.

**Position: _Software Engineer/Game designer_**   
**In:** _Innopolis University Student Affairs Office_   
**Period:** *2017 Summer*   
**My work:**  
I led the team that worked on the text quest in **telegram bot**. This bot was designed for the freshman students of university for easier adaptation and inforamtion sharing. We used **Telebot API** and **Python** language for implementation. I was responsible for architecture, programming and game design parts of the project.
As the result we had ready for use telegram bot based **text quest**.

You can find detailed description in [portfolio]({{site.url}}/hello-freshman) section and playable version here: [@HelloFreshmanBot](http://t.me/HelloFreshmanBot)   
(after '/start' command wait 5-10 sec until bot starts on server. It takes some time because bot is deployed on free Heroku server.)
