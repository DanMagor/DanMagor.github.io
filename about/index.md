## Work Experience:

**Place:** _Innopolis University Student Affairs Office_   
**Period:** *2017 Summer*   
**My work:**

**Place:** [_Fair Games Company_](http://fairgames.studio/)   
**Period:** *2018 Summer*   
**My work:**   
I worked on the part of "Start-up Simulator". I developed sites for in-game internet simulation. Also the big part of my work was mini-games. During the internship I designed such mini-games as: "bar darts", "drag-racing", "board game", "isometric shooter" and several others. The main idea of these mini games was that there was correlation between mini-game results and player's relationships with characters in the game.
